  # In order to migrate all of your Tenants you need to provide a list of Tenant names to Apartment.
  # You can make this dynamic by providing a Proc object to be called on migrations.
  # This object should yield either:
  # - an array of strings representing each Tenant name.
  # - a hash which keys are tenant names, and values custom db config (must contain all key/values
  #   required in database.yml)

  #     port: 5555,
  #     database: 'postgres' # this is not the name of the tenant's db
  #                          # but the name of the database to connect to before creating the

  # Apartment can be forced to use raw SQL dumps instead of schema.rb for creating new schemas.
  # Use this when you are using some extra features in PostgreSQL that can't be respresented in
  # schema.rb, like materialized views etc. (only applies with use_schemas set to true).
  # (Note: this option doesn't use db/structure.sql, it creates SQL dump by executing pg_dump)
  #
  # config.use_sql = false

  # There are cases where you might want some schemas to always be in your search_path
  # e.g when using a PostgreSQL extension like hstore.
  # Any schemas added here will be available along with your selected Tenant.

  # config.persistent_schemas = %w{ hstore }

  # <== PostgreSQL only options
  #

  # By default, and only when not using PostgreSQL schemas, Apartment will prepend the environment
  # to the tenant name to ensure there is no conflict between your environments.
  # This is mainly for the benefit of your development and test environments.
  # Uncomment the line below if you want to disable this behaviour in production.

  # Apartment supports parallelizing migrations into multiple threads when you
  # have a large number of tenants. By default, parallel migrations is turned
  # off. You can enable this by setting parallel_migration_threads to the
  # number of threads you want to use in your initializer.
  #
  # Keep in mind that because migrations are going to access the database, the
  # number of threads indicated here should be less than the pool size that
  # Rails will use to connect to your database.
  #
  # At the time of this writing, the pool-size is 20
